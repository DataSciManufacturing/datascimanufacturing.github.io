# Topics & Schedule 

The schedule is a guide and **subject to change**. Optional courses and hand-on tutorials especially may be adapted to meet more closely the needs of participants. 

The course is expected to require a total __time investment of 5-10h / week__, roughly split into

* 1h video material (at own pace)
* 1h reading (optional)
* 2h tutorial (optional)
* 1h Q&A sessions (optional)
* 1-2h individual project work

## The course features ## 

* Recorded __video lectures__, mostly organised into bite-sized chunks of _5-10min_, with a few longer videos 20-25min, which can be watched at one's own pace. 
* __Reading materials__ in the form of text book chapters and (easy to understand) scientific papers, associated with topics and lectures.  
* Except for Week 1 and 2, __participants choose from a set of optional sub-topics__ (see below)
* Individual sub-topics are tested in __mini-quizzes__ 
* Questions about topics will be discussed in general __Q&A sessions__, once a week. 
* __2h live tutorials__ are provided for 
  * design and critiquing exercises, as well as
  * for a selection of free, open source and commercial data visualisation and visual analytics tools, to demonstrate the range of features available, skills required and user support, for deriving insight into data through visual exploration and analysis. While not compulsory, participants are encouraged to take full advantage of these sessions to engage in discussions with peers and invited subject matter and domain experts, and to obtain direct feedback on assignments.
* __Drop-in support__ to help with data visualisation briefs, ideally using participantsâ€™ own data, create a design to meet the requirements identified, and, within the constraints of the course, build a visualisation-driven solution.
* __Complementary teaching material__ in the form of interactive websites will be provided to participants throughout the course.
* At least once a fortnight we will host a __1h live seminar by a guest speaker__ from academia or industry illustrating application of data visualisation in a variety of fields and the benefits this brings to creating value and gaining a competitive edge,
* A __dedicated Slack/Teams channel__ will support networking and discussions.

# Schedule

Each week will focus on one key topic:

* __Weeks 1 to 3__ focus on __mandatory topics__ to provide a general understanding of the main concepts in data visualisation design.  
* __Weeks 4 &amp; 5__ focus on __visualisation techniques__ for specific data types as relational data, temporal data, geographical, etc.
* __Weeks 6 &amp; 7__ look at the __application areas__ for data visualisation in a variety of scenarios with an aim to help participants identify and select from different solutions for the challenges defined.
* __Week 8__ will take a breather from lecture material and focus on project 1-on-1s, where we will go through projects with participants. These sessions will allow participants to discuss their ideas and work to this point with one of the organisers, and to receive interim feedback.
* __Weeks 9 &amp; 10__ conclude the course with a set of __advanced topics__, from which participants will select options to focus on, ideally in line with their project. 

## Week 1: Foundations

Weeks 1, 2 &amp; 3 focus on mandatory topics to provide a general understanding of the main concepts in data visualisation design. 

* success stories
* perception &amp; cognition
* colour
* visual variables
* Gestalt laws
* visual literacy
* visual metaphors
* exploratory discovery and analysis
* pattern discovery
* explanatory visualisation


## Weeks 2 &amp; 3: Design &amp; Tools

* visualisation design process
* misleading/deceptive visualisation
* scenarios
* data challenges
* cultural norms (social, geographical &amp; organisational)
* visualisation taxonomies
* tool overview/introduction (with a focus on features &amp; skill requirements)


## Week 4: Techniques I

Weeks 6 &amp; 7 focuses on visualisation techniques for specific data types. Participants will select from the options below which to focus on, ideally in line with their project

* statistical visualisation / basic charts
* multivariate / high-dimensional data
* geographical data 


## Week 5: Techniques II
* network visualisation
* trees and hierarchies / focus+context
* temporal data 
<!-- * text data visualisation -->


## Weeks 6 &amp; 7: Application areas

Weeks 6 &amp; 7 looks at the application of data visualisation in a variety of scenarios with an aim to help participants identify and select from different solutions for the challenges defined.

* data-driven storytelling
* data physicalisation 
* personal data visualisation


## Week 8: Project One-on-Ones


## Week 9: 	

* Evaluation


## Week 10:

* Interaction



# Guest Talks

We will host a variety of guest talks, some of which will be run in conjunction with the [Edinburgh Data Visualisation Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-vBHbCmgh). Talks last year covered a variety of areas, with speakers' backgrounds across diverse areas including:
* digital humanities
* knowledge representation
* data journalism 
* personal and social data
* bioinformatics/biological data visualisation
* data-driven storytelling
* interaction techniques
* immersive environments &ndash; MR/VR/AR/XR
