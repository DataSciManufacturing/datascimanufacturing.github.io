# Course Content

Please note the schedule is a guide only, and **subject to change**. Options courses and hand-on tutorials especially may be adapted to meet more closely the needs of participants. Invited seminars will be presented by a range of speakers from academia, different industry sectors and the third sector.

All course material will be accessible online. This will be supplemented by hands-on sessions in a virtual classroom. While not compulsory, participants are encouraged to take full advantage of these sessions to engage in discussions with peers and invited subject matter and domain experts, and to obtain first-hand access to tutorials and direct feedback on assignments.

Weeks 1&ndash;3 will focus on mandatory topics that provide a general understanding of the main concepts in data visualisation. With an aim to help participants identify and select from different solutions for the challenges defined, week 4 will look at application of data visualisation in a variety of scenarios. The course will conclude in week 5 with a set of advanced topics, from which participants will select options to focus on, ideally in line with their project.
