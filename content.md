# Topics & Schedule 

The schedule is a guide and **subject to change**. Optional courses and hand-on tutorials especially may be adapted to meet more closely the needs of participants. 

The course is expected to require a total __time investment of 5-10h / week__, roughly split into

* 1h lecture - video material 
* 1h reading (optional)
* 2h workshop tutorials 
* 1h Q&A sessions (optional)
* 1-2h individual project work

## The course features ## 

* Synchronous and asynchronous __video lectures__.
* __Reading materials__ in the form of text book chapters and (easy to understand) scientific papers, associated with topics and lectures.  
* Questions about topics will be discussed in general __Q&A sessions__, once a week. 
* __2h live workshop tutorials__ are provided for 
  * design and critiquing exercises, as well as
  * for a selection of free, open source and commercial data analytics tools, to demonstrate the range of features available, skills required and user support, for deriving insight into data through exploration and analysis. While not compulsory, participants are encouraged to take full advantage of these sessions to engage in discussions with peers and invited subject matter and domain experts, and to obtain direct feedback on assignments.
* __Drop-in support__ to help with briefs, create a design to meet the requirements identified, and, within the constraints of the course, build a data-driven solution.
* __Complementary teaching material__ in the form of videos and websites will be provided to participants throughout the course.
* At least once every 2 to 3 weeks we will host a __1h live seminar by a guest speaker__ from academia or industry illustrating application of data science in a variety of fields and the benefits this brings to creating value and gaining a competitive edge and other manufacturing related insights.
* A __dedicated Slack/Teams channel__ will support networking and discussions.

# Course Structure

The course is developed to facilitate hybrid teaching and is compromised of a series of lectures, tutorials/workshop sessions that will encourage student-centred learning. A combination of technical lectures, guest speakers from industry and practical manufacturing experience will be employed to allow students to make informed decisions regarding the selection and effective implementation of such manufacturing approaches. 
 

<!-- * __Weeks 9 &amp; 10__ conclude the course with a set of __advanced topics__, from which participants will select options to focus on, ideally in line with their project. 
* __Week 11__ is not a taught week. It's to finish your projects which you have to hand in at the end of that week. -->
