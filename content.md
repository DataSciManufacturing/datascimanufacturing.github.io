# Topics & Schedule 

The schedule is a guide and **subject to change**. Optional courses and hand-on tutorials especially may be adapted to meet more closely the needs of participants. 

The course is expected to require a total __time investment of 10-15h / week__, roughly split into

* 2h video material (optional)
* 2h reading (optional)
* 4h tutorial (optional)
* 2h Q&A sessions (optional)
* 2h individual project work

## The course features ## 

* Recorded __video lectures__, organised into small _5-10min_ videos and which can be watched at one's own pace. 
* __Reading materials__ in the form of text book chapters and (easy to understand) scientific papers, associated to topics and lectures.  
* Except for Week 1 and 2, __participants choose from a set of optional sub-topics__ (see below)
* Individual sub-topics are tested in __mini-quizzes__ 
* Questions about topics can be discussed in general __Q&A sessions__, twice a week. 
* __2h live tutorials__ are provided for 
  * design and critiquing exercises, as well as
  * for a selection of free, open source and commercial data visualisation and visual analytics tools, to demonstrate the range of features available, skills required and user support, for deriving insight into data through visual exploration and analysis. While not compulsory, participants are encouraged to take full advantage of these sessions to engage in discussions with peers and invited subject matter and domain experts, and to obtain first-hand access to tutorials and direct feedback on assignments.
* __Drop-in support__ to help with data visualisation brief, ideally using participantsâ€™ own data, create a design to meet the requirements identified, and, within the constraints of the course, build a visualisation-driven solution.
* __Complementary teaching material__ in the form of interactive websites will be provided to participants throughout the course.
* Each week features a __1h life seminar by a guest speaker__ from academia and industry illustrating application of data visualisation in a variety of fields and the benefits this brings to creating value and gaining a competitive edge,
* A __dedicated Slack/Teams channel__ will support networking and discussions.

# Schedule

Each week is structured in to two sessions covering 2 different topics.

* __Weeks 1 and 2__ focus on __mandatory topics__ to provide a general understanding of the main concepts in data visualisation design.  
* __Week 3__ focuses on __visualisation techniques__ for specific data types as relational data, temporal data, geographical, etc.
* __Week 4__ looks at the __application areas__ for data visualisation in a variety of scenarios with an aim to help participants identify and select from different solutions for the challenges defined.
* __Week 5__ concludes the course with a set of __advanced topics__, from which participants will select options to focus on, ideally in line with their project.
