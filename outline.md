# Course Outline and Schedule

### Week 1: Introduction and Foundations

Introduction into basics of data visualization. Why are we using data visualization? Why does visualization work?. The lecture includes topics such as perception and color and concepts such as exploratory data analysis, data-driven storytelling, visual variables, visual mappings, visualization pipeline, visualization techniques, visual representation, and visualization literacy.

### Week 2: Visualzation Design

### Week 3: Visualzation Tools 

This lecture overviews and introduces common software applications (tools) to help with both: data analysis and the creation of visualizations. We will overview tools for programming environments such as python (e.g., Seaborn) and javascript (e.g., D3), but also tools using common user interfaces (e.g, Rawgraph, Datawrapper). The lecture will not teach how to use these tools, but focus on a high-level overview of the many different tools and workflows exist to create data visualizations.

### Week 4: Visualization Techniques I 

A selection of lectures on 

### Week 5: Visualization Techniques II 

### Week 6: Storytelling

This lecture focuses on effective presentation techniques when using visualizations in e.g., infographics or presentations. Other presentation media can include videos, posters, and datacomics. The lecture investigates how presenting and talking with visualizations is different than using visualizations for exploring and analyzing data. Spoiler alert: “It’s the audience, stupid!”.

### Week 7: Data Physicalisation & Personal Data Visualisation 

### Week 8: Project 1-on-1s 

### Week 9: Evaluation

This lecture covers techniques to assess if a given visualization technique (existing or your own creation) is “successful”. Successful is a broad term and refers to both effectiveness and efficiency in which a user or audience are supported in their analysis or understanding of the data. The lecture proposes a simple heuristic, Readability, Understandability, Supportiveness_, Truthfulness, Insightfulness and Communication

### Week 10: Interaction

This lecture talks about the need for interaction in visualization and will present a range of interaction techniques for specific visualization related tasks: select, explore, reconfigure, encode, abstract, filter, connect.
