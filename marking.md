### Final course mark

The final course mark comes from these three assignments: 
* quizzes, 
* reflections, and 
* final project

Your final course mark will be one out of: 
* pass (marked as '0' in Learn)
* fail (marked as '-1' in Learn)

Your final mark is calculated as follows

* if someone did not pass or did not submit the final project, the overall course mark is a *fail*.
* if someone passed the final project but did not submit all of the quizzes and reflections you may still be awarded a pass, depending on the quality of all course work and the percentage overall submitted.

All project submissions will receive individual feedback.
