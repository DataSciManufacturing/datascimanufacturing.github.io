# Course in Data Science for Manufacturing

![teaser](images/teaserdsm.png)

The [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk) is hosting, a university-certified, _10-credit_, online course in data science for manufacturing with flexible schedule. The course runs in 2022 from __Month 0th - Month 0th (10 weeks)__ and is dedicated to master students and professionals in---among others---the manufacturing sector.

This online course teaches how to
* Give a grounding in __programming__ with Python, version control with Git and Github and other key software practices.
* Develop an __understanding__ of data formats, their wrangling and management, including CSV and relational databases (SQL), CAD formats and materials. 
* __Develop__ skills in the analysis and visualisation of a range of data using descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis.
* __Introduce__ you to the ramifications of data collection and use in a manufacturing setting
* __Criticise__ data use and practises 
* __Introduce__ collaborative practices around data collection, analysis and presentation.
* Set some context 
  * What types of data can be found in manufacturing
  * How that data can be used on a big level
  * Tactically how the data can be used to optimize processes
* Particular topics
  * Data Carpentry
  * Data visualization 
    * Forms of data (Infographics, Interactives, Physicalizations, Comics, Storytelling,Scientific visualization)
* Machine learning/Data analysis

It covers the fundamentals of 
* exploratory data analysis,
* the importance of data science in manufacturing, 
* tools for data analysis,
* tools and techniques for data visualisation, and
* evaluation.

Meet the organizers and join our **[open info session on MS Teams](TEAMS LINK)** (installed MS Teams application required). The session gives an overview over the course and we will answer questions. Sessions times are 
* Day, Month 00, 6-7pm, BST
* Day, Month 00, 6-7pm, BST


With an aim to build skills that allow participants to directly apply their learning, the course features __online videos and reading material__, __mini tutorials__, __drop-in sessions__,  __complementary online teaching material__, and __seminars by guest speakers__.

<!---We encourage **BYOD---bring and work on your own data project** (we can sign non-disclosure agreements). --->
Class examples will include open-access data on a variety of topical issues such as [climate change](https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org), [COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and gender participation (e.g., [the No Ceilings project](http://www.noceilings.org/about) ([github repository](https://github.com/fathominfo/noceilings-data)), and [Scotland's Open Data Catalogues](http://okfnscot.github.io/open-data-scotland).

### Learning Outcomes
1. **Program** : Identify and deploy strategies for writing, understanding and managing computer programs using Python and version control.
2. **Data** : The ability to wrangle, analyse, learn from and visualise a range of data, in a way that demonstrates its relevance to digital manufacturing.
4. **Evaluation:** : Critically reflect on the results and suggest constructive solutions. 
5. **Communicate** : Communicate around manufacture relevant issues, supported by the use of multiple data sources and appropriate analysis.
6. **Apply** : Competently apply data science techniques and tools.
7. **Professionalism** : Working in collaborative, interdisciplinary teams to a high professional standard.
8. **Understand** : Have knowledge of the data ecosystem of manufacturing companies


### Takeaways 
* A **certificate** to reflect a 10 credit-bearing course at Masters level (SCQF Level 11)
* **Visual representation** of your dataset that enables you to answer the challenge you defined around it before and during the course.
* **Skills** to use data science effectively on manufacture related problems.
