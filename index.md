This online course teaches how to
* visually __explore__ data
* __criticise__ data visualisations, 
* __design__ visualisations, and 
* __implement__ data visualisations. 

It covers the fundamentals of 
* human perception and data visualisation, 
* exploratory data analysis,
* the importance of interaction in exploration, 
* techniques for data visualisation (networks, temporal data, geographic data, etc..), 
* storytelling and communication,
* tools for data visualisation, and
* evaluation.

With an aim to build skills that allow participants to directly apply their learning, the course features __online videos and reading material__, __mini tutorials__, __drop-in sessions__,  __complementary online teaching material__, and __seminars by guest speakers__.

We encourage **BYOD---bring and work on your own data project** (we can sign non-disclosure agreements). Alternatively, class examples will include open-access data on a variety of topical issues such as [climate change](https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org), [COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and gender participation (e.g., [the No Ceilings project](http://www.noceilings.org/about) ([github repository](https://github.com/fathominfo/noceilings-data)), and [Scotland's Open Data Catalogues](http://okfnscot.github.io/open-data-scotland).

### Learning Outcomes
1. **Analyse:** Describe a challenge for a visualisation project and the reasons why visualisation is required. 
2. **Structure:** Break down the project considering its context (target audience, usage scenario), potential tasks that the visualisation should facilitate, and the characteristics of the data set.
3. **Design+Implement:** Create a visualisation through one of various media (website, interactive, infographic, etc.) and through a self-selected set of tools (e.g., Tableau, D3.js), to match the earlier identified challenge.
4. **Evaluation:** Critically reflect on a visualisation design and suggest constructive solutions. 
5. **Apply:** Competently apply a wide range of visualisation techniques and tools, also knowing their particular features and drawbacks.

### Takeaways 
* A **certificate** to reflect a 10 credit-bearing course at Masters level (SCQF Level 11)
* **Visual representation** of your dataset that enables you to answer the challenge you defined around it before and during the course.
* **Skills** to develop further visual literacy to support data-driven work.
