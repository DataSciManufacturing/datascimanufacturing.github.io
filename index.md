# Course in Data Science for Manufacturing

The [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk) is hosting, a university-certified, _10-credit_, online course in data science for manufacturing with flexible schedule. The course runs in 2022 from __Month 0th - Month 0th (10 weeks)__ and is dedicated to master students and professionals in---among others---the manufacturing sector.

This online course teaches how to
* Give a grounding in __programming__ with Python, version control with Git and Github and other key software practices.
* Develop an __understanding__ of data formats, their wrangling and management, including CSV and relational databases (SQL), CAD formats and materials. 
* __Develop__ skills in the analysis and visualisation of a range of data using descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis.
* __Introduce__ you to the ramifications of data collection and use in a manufacturing setting
* __Criticise__ data use and practises 
* __Introduce__ collaborative practices around data collection, analysis and presentation.
* Set some context 
  * What types of data can be found in manufacturing
  * How that data can be used on a big level
  * Tactically how the data can be used to optimize processes
* Particular topics
  * Data Carpentry
  * Data visualization 
    * Forms of data (Infographics, Interactives, Physicalizations, Comics, Storytelling,Scientific visualization)
* Machine learning/Data analysis

It covers the fundamentals of 
* exploratory data analysis,
* the importance of data science in manufacturing, 
* techniques for data visualisation
* tools for data analysis,
* tools for data visualisation, and
* evaluation.

Meet the organizers and join our **[open info session on MS Teams](TEAMS LINK)** (installed MS Teams application required). The session gives an overview over the course and we will answer questions. Sessions times are 
* Day, Month 00, 6-7pm, BST
* Day, Month 00, 6-7pm, BST

With an aim to build skills that allow participants to directly apply their learning, the course features __online videos and reading material__, __mini tutorials__, __drop-in sessions__,  __complementary online teaching material__, and __seminars by guest speakers__. More about the [course organisation](organisation.html) and its [schedule](content.html).

We encourage **BYOD---bring and work on your own data project** (we can sign non-disclosure agreements). Alternatively, class examples will include open-access data on a variety of topical issues such as [climate change](https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org), [COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and gender participation (e.g., [the No Ceilings project](http://www.noceilings.org/about) ([github repository](https://github.com/fathominfo/noceilings-data)), and [Scotland's Open Data Catalogues](http://okfnscot.github.io/open-data-scotland).

### Learning Outcomes
1. **Analyse:** Describe a challenge for a visualisation project and the reasons why visualisation is required. 
2. **Structure:** Break down the project considering its context (target audience, usage scenario), potential tasks that the visualisation should facilitate, and the characteristics of the data set.
3. **Design+Implement:** Create a visualisation through one of various media (website, interactive, infographic, etc.) and through a self-selected set of tools (e.g., Tableau, D3.js), to match the earlier identified challenge.
4. **Evaluation:** Critically reflect on a visualisation design and suggest constructive solutions. 
5. **Apply:** Competently apply a wide range of visualisation techniques and tools, also knowing their particular features and drawbacks.

### Takeaways 
* A **certificate** to reflect a 10 credit-bearing course at Masters level (SCQF Level 11)
* **Visual representation** of your dataset that enables you to answer the challenge you defined around it before and during the course.
* **Skills** to develop further visual literacy to support data-driven work.
