# Tutorial: Design (Sketching)

1. Discussion 1 (10 + 20 min)
    * ***In the main classroom***
    * Quick review of project definition guidelines
    * Quick review of general design guidelines (from lecture material)
    <br />
    
    * ***On your own*** (5 min)
    * Draw four sketches 
         - today's weather
         - what comes to mind when you think of Scotland
         - this classroom
         - draw and annotate an idea of your own
    * Upload your sketches to the [shared tutorial space](https://bit.ly/tutorial2-1_sfcdv_jun2000)
    <br />
    
    * ***In the main classroom***
    * What things do you need to look out for in your design sketches?
       - similarities? differences?
       - visualisation types? abstract? concrete?
       - use of black & white? vs. colour?
       - what ideas came up in freestyle drawing? 
            - does this approach liberate or constrain you in coming up with ideas?
  

1. Activity 1 (30 min) <a name = "design_guidelines"></a> &ndash; _General Guidelines_
   * ***On your own***
    1. Go through your project definition and reflect on the key questions (~5 min)
          - What is the ___(Big) Question___?
          - What do you want to ___communicate___?
          - Who are you ___communicating___ it to?
          - What is the ___purpose___ of your visualisation?
    1. Based on your project definition and data think through potential solutions and sketch designs that illustrate these
          - for this initial exercise focus on what answers your question
               - do not restrict your design to what you already do or the skills you already possess
               - sketching allows you free reign to disentangle yourself from the restrictions of technology and skill/capability
          - the aim is to create sketches that communicate:
               * your design ideas to your intended target and other stakeholders
               * data content to your intended audience
                  - you may use multiple sketches to explore different options
                  - alternatively, you may have a single sketch broken down into sub-parts
    1. What are you communicating to your target users?
         - how are you communicating this?
         - does your design help your users to achieve their goals &mdash; the big question?
         - visualisation approach &ndash; how are you choosing to tell your story? e.g., using a data comic, one or more charts, infographic ...
         - what visualisation techniques will you include? standalone? coupled?
            - are you making use of visual metaphors? do they work for your target users and environment?
            - how will you present your design? structure vs. free flow? e.g., using a storyboard, a mind map, a flow chart, post-its on a board?
          - overview vs. detail, balance between complexity and sufficiency &ndash; remember the data-ink ratio
          - what pre-knowledge do you expect your users to feed into interpreting your visualisation?
          - layout and flow
               - how will users navigate through your solution?
               - where do they start? what support do you provide to help them discover the information they seek?
               - have you provided guides to help them correctly interpret the visualisation and confirm understanding (may include redundant encoding, legends, labelled axes, annotation)
          - aesthetics
               - visual appeal important but not a substitute for clear communication
               - colour palettes, use of patterns
          - static vs. interactive visualisation?
               - is your data dynamic?
               - do you need to visualise change or difference between data elements?
               - are you providing multiple layers?
          - do your users need to extract the underlying data? or summaries?
          - on-screen only? printable? mobile-friendly?  

   __NOTE: remember not to share sensitive data, especially when making annotations - your design need not refer to specific data__<br /><br />

1. Discussion 2 (20 min)
    * ***Within your groups***
    * Discuss your design ideas (choose 1 key area each and allow the opportunity for each person to share their ideas)
    * Solicit and give feedback
    * Nominate one idea or set of related ideas to discuss in class (3 min / group)

1. Activity 2 (15 min)
    * Reflect on general discussion and more specific feedback
         - update your initial ideas as desired
    * Now consider more practical considerations that may impact what of your design you can deliver now
          * do you have the data to build on your design?
               - what additional data processing may be necessary?
               - what additional domain knowledge will you need? do you have access to the experts required?
          * what additional skills will you need to develop?
          * note any practical constraints you envisage, e.g., (course) length and other resources needed to build solution, including technical skills, target user context and capability
               - what are the key elements you want to focus on for implementation - what is often described as the MVP (minimum viable product)?
               - what can be set as future work, that will further enhance your initial delivery?


1. Discussion 3 (20 min)
    * ***In the main classroom***
    - Round table discussion
    - General class feedback
    - Brief summary of reflection exercise, submission requirements and due date
   <br />    

___Before submission &ndash; reflect on your design choices by revisiting especially point (iii) in the [guidelines](#design_guidelines) for this exercise___

# Reflection Exercise

Edit your sketches and/or include annotations that take into account also any feedback and discussions during the tutorial. If need be, update your project brief to reflect evolution of your project ideas (you do not need to submit your updated brief).

Submit a copy of your design to <a href="https://bit.ly/submission_reflection_exercises">Learn</a>.
