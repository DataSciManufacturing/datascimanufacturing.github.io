### Tutorial 2-1: Design (Sketching)

1. Discussion 1 (10 + 20 min)
    * ***In the main classroom***
    * quick review of project definition guidelines
    * quick review of general design guidelines (from lecture material)
    <br />
    
    * ***On your own*** (5 min)
    * Draw four sketches 
         - today's weather
         - what comes to mind when you think of Scotland
         - this classroom
         - draw and annotate an idea of your own
    * Upload your sketches to the shared space
    <br />
    
    * ***In the main classroom***
    * What things do you need to to look out for in your design sketches?
       - similarities? differences?
       - visualisation types? abstract? concrete?
       - use of black & white? vs. colour?
       - what ideas came up in freestyle drawing? 
            - does this approach liberate or constrain you in coming up with ideas?
  
1. Activity 1 (30 min)
   * ***On your own***
     1. Go through your project definition and reflect on the key questions (~5 min)
          - What is the (Big) Question?
          - What do you Want to Communicate?
          - Who are you Communicating it to?
          - What is the Purpose of your Visualisation?
     1. Based on your project definition and data think through potential solutions and sketch designs that illustrate these
          - for this initial exercise focus on what answers your question
               - do not restrict your design to what you already do or the skills you already possess
               - sketching allows you free reign to disentangle yourself from the restrictions of technology and skill/capability
          - the aim is to create sketches that communicate:
               * your design ideas to your intended target and other stakeholders
               * data content to your intended audience
               - you may use multiple sketches to explore different options
               - alternatively, you may have a single sketch broken down into sub-parts
     1. What are you communicating to your target users?
            - how are you communicating this?
            - does your design help your users to achieve their goals - the big question?
         - visualisation approach - how are you choosing to tell your story? e.g., a data comic, one or more charts, infographic ...
            - what visualisation techniques will you include? standalone? coupled?
            - are you making use of visual metaphors? do they work for your target users and environment?
            - how will you present your design? structure vs. free flow? e.g., using a storyboard, a mind map, a flow chart, post-its on a board?
          - overview vs. detail, balance between complexity and sufficiency - remember the data-ink ratio
          - what pre-knowledge do you expect your users to feed into interpreting your visualisation?
          - layout and flow
               - how will users navigate through your solution?
               - where do they start? what support do you provide to help them discover the information they seek?
               - have you provided guides to help them correctly interpret the visualisation and confirm understanding (may include redundant encoding, legends, labelled axes, annotation)
          - aesthetics
               - visual appeal important but not a substitute for clear communication
               - colour palettes, use of patterns
          - static vs. interactive visualisation?
               - is your data dynamic?
               - do you need to visualise change or difference between data elements?
               - are you providing multiple layers?
          - do your users need to extract the underlying data? or summaries?
          - on-screen only? printable? mobile-friendly?
   <br />

   **NOTE: remember not to share sensitive data, especially when making annotations - your design need not refer to specific data**


1. Discussion 2 (20 min)
    * ***Within your groups***
    * Discuss your design ideas (choose 1 key area each and allow the opportunity for each person to share their ideas)
    * Solicit and give feedback
    * Nominate one idea or set of related ideas to discuss in class (3min / group)

1. Activity 2 (15 min)
    * Reflect on general discussion and more specific feedback
         - update your initial ideas as desired
    * now consider more practical considerations that may impact what of your design you can deliver now
          * do you have the data to build on your design?
               - what additional data processing may be necessary?
               - what additional domain knowledge will you need? do you have access to the experts required?
          * what additional skills will you need to develop?
          * note any practical constraints you envisage, e.g., (course) length and other resources needed to build solution, including technical skills, target user context and capability
               - what are the key elements you want to focus on for implementation - what is often described as the MVP (minimum viable product)?
               - what can be set as future work, that will further enhance your initial delivery?


1. Discussion 3 (20 min)
    * ***In the main classroom***
    - Round table discussion
    - General class feedback
    - Brief summary of reflection exercise, submission requirements and due date
   <br />    

***Before submission &ndash; reflect on your design choices by revisiting especially point 3 in the guidelines for this exercise***

Tutorial2-2a Tool Marketplace

*** Discussion 1: 10min
  * Within your groups (with experience in X)
    - choose two visualisation types in common
    - what tools do you typically use?
      - what functionality do you focus on?
      - what data do you work with? - type, size, dimensionality, ...
    - what guides your choice of tool?
      - what works well?
      - any challenges or restrictions?
      - any domain or sector differences?
    - what other tools have you considered for the same purpose/tasks(s)
      - how do they compare with your tool of choice?
    ** where do the tools you have experience of fit on the feature/functionality matrix?
  
Discussion 2: 10min
  * Within your groups (looking to acquire skill in X)
    - choose two visualisation types in common you wish to develop skill in
    - what do you aim to achieve?
    - what features or functionality are you looking for?
    - is your existing skillset a benefit or a barrier? how easily can you transfer existing experience and skills to a new tool(s)
    ** where would you place your tool (and output) requirements on the feature/functionality matrix?
    
Discussion 2: 20min
  * Whole class -
  * features to consider when searching for and selecting tools - among others:
      - end use:
        - users' domain knowledge & skill
        - user tasks - e.g., discovery, exploration, analysis, storytelling
      - technological resources - for both development and use
      - domain and technological expertise and experience (your own and available to you)
      - features, functionality
        - GUI vs coding or command line
        - generic vs specific
      - flexibility vs intuitiveness
      - data input: format, size, dimensionality, multi-source
      - output: static vs interactive
      - sharing & accessibility
        - need to download data and/or analysis results?
        - need to print? embed into reports? reuse in other tools?
        - use or share over a network?
      - cost - time, money, knowledge, people
