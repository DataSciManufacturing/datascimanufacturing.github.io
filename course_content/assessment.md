# Assessment

This course is accredited; on successful completion you will receive a certificate that reflects 10 credits at Masters-level (SCQF Level 11). 

It therefore has a formal assessment component comprising
  * mini quizzes attached to key lecture topics
  * brief reflection exercises linked to the tutorials  <!-- [reflection exercises](reflection_exercises) linked to the tutorials -->  
  * a final project that enables you to answer, using your data visualisation choice, the challenge you define.


## General Submission Guidelines

1. Submission of (individual) quizzes and exercises assignments must be labelled using your exam number only; please ensure you do not include any personally identifiable information. Group exercises should use group ID, date and exercise number.
<!-- Your exam number is the number that starts with B on your student card. -->

1. Quizzes will require selection from a multi-choice list and/or require a brief written answer.
1. Reflection exercises must contain ~200 and no more than 500 words, and fit on a single side of A4 paper. 
  * keep descriptions brief and to the point. Use bulleted lists rather than prose to provide detail for key points.
  * number all figures and further annotate sketches and diagrams as required. 
  * you may use a non-traditional, visualisation-based (rather than text-based) method to submit reflection exercises, provided it communicates the information required effectively.
