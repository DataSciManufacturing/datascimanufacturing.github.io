# Assessment

This course is accredited; on successful completion you will receive a certificate that reflects 10 credits at Masters-level (SCQF Level 11). 

It therefore has a formal assessment component comprising
  * mini quizzes attached to key lecture topics
  * brief reflection exercises linked to the tutorials  <!-- [reflection exercises](reflection_exercises) linked to the tutorials -->  
  * a final project that enables you to answer, using your data visualisation choice, the challenge you define.

Your overall grade will be one of __Pass__ / __Fail__ / __Incomplete__

## General Submission Guidelines

1. Formal assessment must be submitted through Learn. Quizzes and assignments must be labelled using your student ID only (s followed by 7 numbers); please ensure you do not include any personally identifiable information. 
1. In-session exercises should be labelled with your student ID  (individual)  or group number, date and exercise number, and uploaded to the shared space for the tutorial in question. 

### Quizzes
 * Require selection from a multi-choice list and/or a brief written answer
 * For questions with a written component please provide brief answers. You may use one or a combination of 
   * a short paragraph, up to 5 lines, and ideally not more than 50 words
   * up to 5 bullet points
 
#### Grading &amp; feedback
 * You may attempt each quiz up to 3 times; your highest score will feed into your overall grade
 * There will be a short delay between quiz submission and grading. You will receive an overall score and breakdown by question, in addition to written feedback for the first attempt at any question that has a written component.
<br />

**All quizzes must be completed by 23:59 on Jul 17th.**

### Assignments / Reflection exercises
 * Assignments are linked to tutorial sessions; while you are **NOT required to attend** these sessions **you MUST submit all assignments**. Guidelines for completing the exercises are detailed in the tutorial scripts, with summaries provided in the <a href="summaries_reflection_exercises">table</a> below. 

 * Submissions must contain ~200 and no more than 500 words, and fit on a single side of A4 paper
   * keep descriptions brief and to the point
   * use bulleted lists rather than prose to provide detail for key points
 * You may include diagrams, sketches and other visual annotations
   * please number figures referenced within text and further annotate sketches and any other diagrams as required
 <br />
  
 * You may submit reflection exercises using a non-traditional, visualisation-based method (rather than text-based), provided it communicates the information required effectively.

#### Submission deadlines, grading &amp; feedback
 * Assignments feed into completing your final project. Individual feedback will be structured to allow you to update the individual components of your final report. **You must submit assignments by the due date to receive individual feedback**. 
 * No penalty will be applied if you submit assignments after their due date. However, priority for providing feedback moves to the next assignment after each cutoff; unless you have obtained special dispensation you may not receive individual feedback in time to apply this to subsequent assignments and your final project.
<br />
 
**All assignments must be submitted by 23:59 on Jul 17th.**
