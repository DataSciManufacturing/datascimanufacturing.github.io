## Week 3

### Tutorial 3-1: EDA &ndash; Own Data

1. Discussion 1 (10 min)
    * ***In the main classroom***
    * Reflect on your [first EDA tutorial](tutorials.md#1-2b)
    * What did you learn from using:
        - different analytical techniques
        - preparing your data
    - What questions did you ask?
    - What paths did you follow and why?
    - Deriving insight ...
        - what initial assumptions did you confirm or refute?
        - what new did you discover about your data?

1. Activity 1 (40 min) 

   __Data preparation tutorial__
      * __Note: this exercise uses data from open data sources__
    <!--  * This exercise uses data from National Records Scotland's 2019 population estimates<sup>[1](#ref-nrs-2019pop_estimates)</sup> and the time series<sup>[2](#ref-nrs-2019time_series)</sup> data-->
    <br />
    
    * ***In the main classroom***
    * Using the open data and also guidelines from the  [first EDA tutorial](tutorials.md#1-2b)
        - reformat the data as required for your tool of choice
        - generate simple statistical and visual summaries for each dataset
    * Q&A (10min)  

1. Activity 2 (45 min)
    * ***On your own*** (even if working on a group project)
  
    * __Note: this is an exercise in exploring your data, not your design__
        - what you find in the data __will however influence__ your design
        - you will need to explore your raw data  
            AND transformations of the data  
            AND the results of different kinds of analysis
        - no set way to do this, there are guidelines that help you _follow your nose_
        - you may find you need to look for more or new data, and/or perform more cleaning on your original dataset
    * Remember this is an ___iterative exercise___
        - you may start with fixed ideas or questions OR  
              a vague idea of what you're looking for OR  
              gut based on experience and implicit knowledge
        - expect to find more questions to your initial question(s)
        - expect to find answers that contradict your initial assumptions
        - it is not unusual to throw away some of your original questions and formulate new ones
    * Remember to ___challenge your initial ideas and solutions___
    * Experiment with multiple perspectives
        - start with basic statistical analysis (if you have numerical data) and other overviews (any type of data)
            - visualise your original dataset and results of analysis
        - do you have any initial hypotheses?
            - these can be derived from your ___big question___
            - hypotheses may be based on knowledge of your domain and/or data content
        - try out different visualisation techniques; different perspectives typically expose different aspects of your data
        - alter settings for the same technique, e.g., different bins for a histogram may reveal different patterns
  
  
1. Discussion 2 (15 min)
    * ***In the main classroom***
    * Reflect on:
      - lessons learnt
      - challenges encountered

    * Informal exercise (no resubmission required at this stage) &ndash; update your visualisation brief and design
    * Optional exercise &ndash; provide a review for the tool(s) you used in the [VisBrowser](https://vistools.net)
        - please specify that the tool was being used for EDA and comment on usability and utility for this purpose
        - in your review describe briefly your input data type, size and complexity

### Tutorial 3-2: Critical Analysis

1. Activity 1 (35 min)
    * ***On your own*** (even if working on a group project)
    - Reflect on:
        - your brief and design *ndash; what is your ___big question___?
        - the results of EDA on your data and the impact it had on your data preparation and design
   
   __General Guidelines__  
   1. Critically evaluate your brief and design, looking at potential for visual communication
        - review the guidelines you followed when formulating your brief and creating your (initial) design
    
   2. Identify key elements of your design
        - what would constitute an MVP?
        - what can you practically achieve within the constraints of this course?
        - what can you categorise as the next phase of the project (future work)?
    
   3. Critically evaluate your goals in light of:
        - your skill/capability and other resources you have access to
            - what you have learnt to this point
            - which advanced topics you plan to study
            - additional skills you wish to learn
        - any other recognised constraints, including
            - time limits of course
            - data needed to achieve your overall goal
      
    * Create a check list with 3-5 items to guide evaluation of your brief and design
        - draw from the lecture and tutorial material
        - draw from your requirements and goals - this will require you to think from your target users' viewpoint
    
  
1. Discussion 1 (60 min)
    * ***Within your group*** (2 * 15 min)
    1. Exchange design briefs, along with your evaluation checklists  
        Each must be evaluated by two others in your group
        - Provide __constructive__, albeit __critical__ feedback. This is an opportunity for peer learning, to gain from others' experience and perspectives.
        - Remember to provide feedback within context; seek more information about intended use and users if not obvious
        - Identify
            - what works well
            - what is unclear &ndash; seek clarification / ask questions
            - what can be improved - you need not suggest how to improve, but illustrate why some aspect may not deliver as intended
        - Summarise your overall impressions
          - first impressions
          - what does this design communicate? How well does it match its brief?
        
    2. Individually *ndash; review feedback for your design (10 min)
        - you may obtain both overlapping and conflicting feedback
        - remember your evaluators have different perspectives, differences in feedback are the norm
      
    3. Round table &ndash; discuss, at a more general level
        - this is an opportunity for you to ask more questions, seek clarification on feedback obtained, provide clarification on feedback given
        - identify where and how different techniques work to inform, help to perform tasks and answer question

  __NOTE: remember not to share sensitive data, especially when making annotations - your design need not refer to specific data. Consult with a tutor if this presents an issue for obtaining peer feedback.__
    

1. Activity 2 (15 min)
  * ***On your own  (or group if in group project)***
  * Review feedback and update brief and design as desired
