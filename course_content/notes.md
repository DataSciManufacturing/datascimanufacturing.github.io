# Project Advice

This page offers some thougths to help you structure your projects. The advice will be updated.

Please come to the **Q&A sessions** and ask questions to discuss your projects. This really is your time and much can be learned from the other's questions. I am sorry for those who have missed the opportunity. From the conversations I have had so far, I am sharing some general suggestions on the problems below:

Many struggling to **scope the data and questions for the final project**. This is totally normal. Try to pose yourself the following questions: 

	1. **What information do I want to get across?** E.g., I want to show the distribution / frequency / trend over time for my variable X. Saying 'to visualize all these data' is not about information. Information are: trends, missing data, relationships, frequencies, outliers, temporal change, differences, distributions, ... 
	1. It's a good strategy to **think of 1-2 columns** (from your spreadsheet) at a time and create a visualization just for those. 
	1. That means, **break down the complexity** of your big, complex, multivariate dataset into little manageable pieces. Divide and conquer.
	1. You can take the lectures on the **data types** as inspiration (weeks 4+5): is there time in my dataset? Is there geography? Are there relationships? Are there quantitative values and stats? Can I visualize one at a time? Create a sketch for each of these aspects. 
	1. Try to go through points a-c for some of your initial questions (information) and **create a set of simple visualizations**. Focus on hand sketches with your favourite pen. Get your hands dirty. Clutter your floor/wall/door/kitchen/garden with sketches and drafts. No draft is a waste. If were had physical lessons, we'd pin all of them onto our studio wall. You do most of the errors by too quickly deciding on one single (sub-optimal) solution and then stick with it. 
	1. Sleep over all of this.
	1. Once this is done, you have a couple of options: 
		 1. **Compile all those (small, simple) visualizations into a 'dashboard' / website / infographic.** I.e., place those visualizations into an overview that makes sense. E.g., group similar information (e.g., trends) or data types (time); put the most important information at the top or in the center, etc.. There is little guidance that one can give as there are no good resources (yet). 
		 1. **Make your charts interactive**. You can allow for filtering through menus or time sliders. This will allow your users to select the part of the data they are interested in. Keep in mind that interaction
			  1. Needs to be learned, and 
				1. Needs to be executed. 
			There is a cost for knowing that I can interact, and how I interact and there is a cost in doing this interaction each time. The most simple interaction is scrolling. If you can show through all your charts, why not doing that? Add a menu on top for quick access. You can do this in any website or system that uses markdown.
		 1.** Create a very sophisticated bespoke visualization** that includes as much information from your data into a single (but complex) image. E.g., a geographic map that includes time and different categorical data. This is challenging and will require potentially several tools (illustrator, d3) and low-level designing using visual variables, glyphs, etc. 
	1. In engaging with these questions, keep the following in mind: 
		 1. **think about your audience / your persona(s)**. Imagine a scenario in which your future user will read those visualizations and how they will relate information. 
		 1. **What tools do I master?** What tool would I need? Can I learn that tool in that short time? 
	1. The **best project submission** is one that shows the following: 
		 1. You have a **clear and nicely scoped brief** that shows you are using visualization to show information. 
		 1. You have a **good rationale for your visualization(s)**, based on the concepts discussed in the lectures. 
		 1. You have **gotten your hands dirty**, e.g., you have created an actual visualization and seen your data through visualizations. You learn so much by seeing your data. 
		 1. All the remainder of your ideas (e.g., those cluttering your garden) you can use to select the best and most complementary to those in point c above and add sketches to the submission about how you would extend your solution if you had more time. We hope this will help you with your personal / professional projects beyond the course.
