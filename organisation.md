# Course Description

This online course aims to equip participants with the skills to use visualisation to uncover insight, to improve question answering, information discovery, to support informed decision-making and the creation of value from data.

The course is **NOT** 
* about creating dashboards,
* a [D3](https://d3js.org), [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com), [GGplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) or other visualisation library programming course,
* a Tableau, PowerBI, SAS or other commercial visualisation tool course.

This course **WILL**
* help you to develop analytical thinking and engage with your data,
* teach you how to handle ambiguity in your data,
* help you to complement your domain expertise with creativity for problem solving and knowledge discovery,
* teach how to assess and match your data needs to functionality and tools for data visualisation (with examples drawn from a variety of tools including Tableau, Rawgraphs, D3.js).

Contextual knowledge plays a key role in data interpretation and use. While this may be harnessed to create more meaningful, insightful visualisations, context may also be exploited to unfairly influence or actively mislead - topics that will be covered during the course. We encourage **BYOD---bring and work on your own data project** (we can sign non-disclosure agreements). Alternatively, class examples will point to open-access data on a variety of topical issues such as [climate change](https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org), gender participation (e.g., [the No Ceilings project](http://www.noceilings.org/about) --- [github repository](https://github.com/fathominfo/noceilings-data)), [Scotland's Open Data Catalogues](http://okfnscot.github.io/open-data-scotland) and the [National Records of Scotland (NRS)](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data).

### Learning Outcomes
1. **Program** : Identify and deploy strategies for writing, understanding and managing computer programs using Python and version control.
2. **Data** : The ability to wrangle, analyse, learn from and visualise a range of data, in a way that demonstrates its relevance to digital manufacturing.
4. **Evaluation:** : Critically reflect on the results and suggest constructive solutions. 
5. **Communicate** : Communicate around manufacture relevant issues, supported by the use of multiple data sources and appropriate analysis.
6. **Apply** : Competently apply data science techniques and tools.
7. **Professionalism** : Working in collaborative, interdisciplinary teams to a high professional standard.
8. **Understand** : Have knowledge of the data ecosystem of manufacturing companies


### Takeaways 
* A **certificate** to reflect a 10 credit-bearing course at Masters level (SCQF Level 11)
* **Visual representation** of your dataset that enables you to answer the challenge you defined around it before and during the course.
* **Skills** to use data science effectively on manufacture related problems.

## Course Summary

This course teaches general knowledge about theory, application, design, and evaluation of visualisations. The goal of the course is to enable participants to understand the potential of visualisation for exploration, analysis, and communication.

The course targets professionals working in, among others, finance, the sports industry, the creative industry, in journalism, education and in the public sector. It will enable participants to describe a visualisation problem, to explore the data using data visualisation, to discuss and design appropriate visualisation concepts, and to implement and critically reflect on them. The bi-disciplinary approach, from the Computer Science and Social Sciences perspectives, aims to increase accessibility and ensures both grounding in technical understanding and application across sectors.  

The course is designed for an interdisciplinary audience, targeting participants with a background in manufacturing, data analysis, and other areas. In addition to core, mandatory [topics](./content.html) that aim to develop data analysis literacy, participants can chose from a variety of optional, more specialised topics during the course.

General __programming skills are not required__. The course will give you an overview of a range of commercial and open source tools to help you decide what works best for your project and skills.

The final assessment will require participants to work on an open visualisation project of their choice, which can, e.g., include their own data or use open data. The end goal could be any of, but not limited to, the following: 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align:top;">
      <ul>
        <li>an infographic, </li>
        <li>an interactive visualisation (e.g., using d3.js, <a href="https://plot.ly">Plotly</a>) </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr><tr>

        <li>a data-driven, visual story or narrative such as a <a href="http://datacomics.net">data comic</a>, or a set of visual instructions using a <a href="https://visualizationcheatsheets.github.io">cheat sheet</a>.</li>

In addition to self-directed, online learning, individual help and feedback will be provided through forums and email, drop-in online-sessions, and local workshops in Edinburgh. 

Tutorials and talks will be held at the University of Edinburgh, and along with external seminars, will be live-streamed and recorded for an online audience. 

We aim to ensure course delivery is as flexible as possible to accommodate each participantâ€™s work schedule. Course content is delivered through recorded online video lectures, suggested readings, online tutorials, quizzes, exercises that can be handed in to obtain feedback as well as optional advanced modules.

Prior to course start, we aim to work with selected participants to shape the course to best accommodate specific needs of working professionals. If you would like to take part in a workshop or taster session please complete a [brief interest survey](https://forms.gle/4Z6wTZkoHMsNL5Yu5), or [e-mail us](https://forms.gle/4Z6wTZkoHMsNL5Yu5).
