## Register interest in surveys and taster sessions

## Completing course application form

A single [form](https://www.ed.ac.uk/bayes/about-us/our-work/education/workforce-development/how-to-apply) is in use for a set of courses within the Bayes Centre's *Data Skills Workforce Development* portfolio; the form must therefore satisfy all courses' requirements and also the University of Edinburgh's formal requirements for course applications. Bearing in mind that the data visualisation course has an atypical target student group, we highlight sections where our requirements may differ from the standard, and provide answers to common questions from applicants. Please [e-mail us](mailto:datavisonline@gmail.com) if you have any other questions. 

### Sections 1&ndash;3 
cover basic personal details &ndash; the form will indicate fields that are required. 

### Section 4&ndash; Programme 

We highlight below only those sections that are mandatory. You may leave other sections blank or enter **N/A** 

#### Personal Statement 

You **MUST** state that you are registering for the course ***'Data Visualisation for Professionals'*** here. This field asks also for some indication for why you are applying for the course. 

### Relevant Knowledge/Training Skills

Please also include a brief summary, describing how you qualify to take the course &ndash; the form provides some detail about what is required here. The university requires this for processing the applications. 


### Sections 5&ndash; Qualifications &amp; 6&ndash; Employment

Because this is an accredited course the university requires evidence of completion of a university degree, with copies of certificates or transcripts or links to institutions that provide verfication of your degree. Please note that *ANY* university degree is acceptable; we do *NOT* require applicants to have a technical or computer-related degree. 

If you do not have a degree or other tertiary qualification please enter ***N/A*** for this section. In this case you **MUST** provide a CV with evidence of professional experience. As above, this may be in *ANY* field.
