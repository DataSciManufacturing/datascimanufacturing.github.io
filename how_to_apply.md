# Course forms

## Completing [course application form]

A single [form](https://www.ed.ac.uk/bayes/about-us/our-work/education/workforce-development/how-to-apply) is in use for a set of courses under the Bayes Centre's *Data Skills Workforce Development* portfolio, and must therefore satisfy all course requirements and also the University of Edinburgh's formal requirements for course applications. We provide a few pointers to common questions from applicants. Bearing in mind also that we have an atypical target student group, we also highlight sections where our requirements may differ from the standard. 

### Sections 1&ndash;3 
cover basic personal details &ndash; the form will indicate fields that qare required. 

### Section 4 &ndash; Programme 

We highlight below only those sections that are mandatory. You may leave the other sections blank or enter **N/A** 

#### Personal Statement 

You **MUST** state that you are registering for the course ***'Data Visualisation for Professionals'*** here. 

### Relevant Knowledge/Training Skills

Please also include a brief summary, describing how you qualify to take the course &ndash; the form provides some detail about what is required here. The university requires this for processing the applications.
