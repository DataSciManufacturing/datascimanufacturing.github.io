## English Language Requirements

Because this is a university-accredited course you **must** meet the university's [formal language requirements](http://www.edin.ac/pgdf-english). This means that you must demonstrate English language competency at a level that will enable you to succeed in your studies, regardless of your nationality or country of residence.
Please confirm that you meet all requirements as early as possible &ndash; detail at [language requirements](http://www.edin.ac/pgdf-english); current restrictions due to COVID have increased delay registering for and taking any tests necessary.


## Fess and Funding
