#### Session topics

* This week is featuring no taught content but gives you time to work on your project. We will take a breather from taught lecture material and focus on project 1-on-1s, where we will go through projects with participants. These sessions will allow participants to discuss their ideas and work to this point with one of the organisers, and to receive interim feedback.
* We will also host a guest lecture on AI/ML in the workplace. Individual, social and cultural factors across the lifecycle by Dr Kendra Briken,Senior Lecturer and Prof Dora Scholarios from the Department of Work, Employment and Organisation at Strathclyde Business School, University of Strathclyde.
